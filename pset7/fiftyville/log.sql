 Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse. Interviews were conducted today with
 three witnesses who were present at the time â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

| 161 | Ruth    | 2020 | 7     | 28  | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get
into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have security
footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for
cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and
 saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

| 163 | Raymond | 2020 | 7     | 28  | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who
 talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning
 to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other
 end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |
